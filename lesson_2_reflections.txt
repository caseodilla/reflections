What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	Initializing a repository begins the version control process. It is then tracking different versions, allowing me to compare one version from another for better debugging.

	I need to do it to initialize the process. That's kind of a no-brainer, stupid question.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area allows me to collect my changes before I upload all of them as part of a single commit. Otherwise, I would always have to commit individual changes that might break apart logical groupings.
